✨ Hi, I'm Maisie Ó Dorchaidhe (full name Mairéad)

✨ I'm a former senior software engineer from AAA games who specialized in low level graphics on console

✨ I'm currently working as a solo developer on some of my own projects as I take a voluntary break from formal employment

✨ You can find me at @modorchaidhe on twitter

✨ I used to go by Margaret Dorsey (my anglicized name) professionally, so that's the best way to look up my game credits :)
